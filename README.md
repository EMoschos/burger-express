  ## Usage 

  ```
  ▶️ 
  
  Once the link has been accessed.  Input data into the text area and click add burger.  This will add a burger to the listing with a button to devour the burger at any point in time.  When the devour button is clicked the burger is eaten and it will then appear on the eaten list but once on the eaten list thats where the burger stays.  This process can be repeated as many times until you feel full enough.
